# PageReplacementSimulation

A page replacement simulation program.

Page Replacement Algorithm decides which page to remove, also called swap out when a new page needs to be loaded into the main memory. Page Replacement happens when a requested page is not present in the main memory and the available space is not sufficient for allocation to the requested page. This application simulates different algorithms used in page replacement.
